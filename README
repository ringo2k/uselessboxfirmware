Little Firmware for the weekendproject "useless box"
This firmware was written on one evening, the PWM is generated in software and the different positions can be different on your servo. But for a simple useless box it is a good start.

* based on Attiny13 uC 
* connect SERVO PWM signal to PB0
* PB3 is LED output 
* PB4 is switch input (LOW active)

* different programs, because the useless box is a moody useless box :-)
